Boot Camp Assignment: Create a simple About Me page.

I was asked to create a simple "About Me" page as a pre-school project for boot camp. The requirements were to utilize multiple headers and divs, and to include images. Bonus points if we created the styles in a separate file.

After creating the initial skeleton and stylesheet, I decided to give myself a little extra honework and make the page completely dynamic regardless of viewport size. I created multiple media queries in order to establish break points and make the page look nice no matter what screen size it's viewed on.
